# MLP-Digits-Recognition
An implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network from scratch in Rust.

## About
This project was created following [3blue1brown's Neural Networks series](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk). The goal of is to implement a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network from scratch in Rust, and use it to recognize handwritten digits from the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
